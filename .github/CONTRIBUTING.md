Thank you for deciding to contribute to lolbot's development, it will possibly help me a lot.
But before you continue to submitting, please read over this:

  - Your code will become licensed under MIT.
  - I will pretty much kinda own your code now.
  - Credit will be given.
  - Code is written in Sublime Text - and its default settings
  - Having Sublime Text available is preferred for PRs, 
  - but other editors are allowed as well as long as they adhere to the standards.
  
  If you agree to all of these, move on.
  
  Once again, thanks for contributing!
