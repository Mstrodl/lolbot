<h1>Vuln reporting</h1>
<p>If you have found a vulnerabillity in lolbot, please send it to any of my contact methods (even if it's my email, or DMs, or IRC PMs.)</p>
<p><b>PLEASE DO NOT:</b></p>
<p>Report vuln in public with reproduction instructions</p>
<p><em>This will cause trouble users to exploit the bot and thus ruining the security of the software<br/> - even if you didn't mean to.</em></p>
<p>Use it against the software</p>
<p><em>This will most likely result in something bad.</em></p>
<p><b>Thank you!</b></p>
