# Warning
I highly suggest you don't run your own instance as lolbot's official instance is 24/7 and there is no place for a self-hosted instance. However,

# if you wanna run it...

## Requirements

- Python 3.6
- pip packages in requirements.txt (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- API token from [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications)

## Running

1. Get your bot token and fill it in config.json
2. Run `python3.6 index.py`
3. Profit(?)

### Features probably never added
I suck ass at music in Python, this will be implemented in a JS bot instead, which makes the chances of a music bot 0.00%.
